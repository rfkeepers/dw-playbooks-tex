%    How to use this.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%   Hi, hello, welcome!  This is the template for building your own playbook
%   with my dockerized playbook builder.  I've put in a lot of effort to make
%   this creation an easy process, and to provide you with prebuilt tools to
%   use. The comments throughout the file should guide you where you need to
%   go. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me via
%   email or discord.
%
%   1.  This .tex document is what will build your playbook's pdf.  As a test
%       run, you should be able to create a pdf out of the template without
%       any issues.  See the `just` commands in the repository for guidance.
%
%   2.  The content of this template is designed to provide as many examples
%       of options and possibilities as I could think of.  Hopefully that's
%       enough to set you up for success! So long as your stuff is reasonably
%       within the fit of the page, it should all come out properly.  Fitting
%       things in the provided space can be a tall order sometimes, so good luck!
%
%   3.  The one thing you do need to be cautious about is whitespace.  You'll
%       see a lot of \\ and \gap and \gapSm throughout the document.  Why?
%       Well, typesetting is a fickle process, and a lot of times it was easier
%       to achieve the correct layout by controlling it in the playbook, rather
%       than building that space into the other commands.  If you feel like
%       the text isn't lining up as well as you'd expect, go back and look at
%       how it was used here in the template.
%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%    Common Errors
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%   It doesn't compile!  There's an error!
%
%   Run it with verbose mode (dw-pdf -v ...).  There's a _lot_ of chaff output,
%   but among it all you should be able to find some kind of error.  Common
%   build errors include:
%
%   1. You have a typo in a \commandName{}.
%   2. You have too many or too few \command{parameters}{supplied}.
%   3. You put an optional \command[first]{parameter} in {} instead of [].
%   4. LaTeX doesn't like that you added a \\ or \gap right there.
%
%   ---
%   The page went blank!  All the content is on the next page!
%
%   You added too much content and now it's overflowing out the bottom of the
%   current page.  Why it produces this particular visual is beyond me.  If the
%   content is on the first page (such as the ancestry or drives), you'll have
%   to trim some out.  If it's on the second or third page you could break out
%   some content to a new page.

% The third page has empty lines for notes on the left-hand column, and I don't
% leave you any options for changing that up.  Everything you can configure here
% goes into the right hand column.
%
% The second block of content is arranged as a double-column layout (for moves).
% The third block of content is single-column.
% If you want the second block to be single-column instead, add [s] to the command
% like so: \pageThree[s]
\pageThree
    % title bar.  replace with a tilde (~) if you don't want one.

    % that doesn't use the standard two-column moves layout, go up to the pagethree

        }
    }
    % a final, single-column section in case you wanted to add both moves and some
    % other single-column formatted content at the bottom of the page.

% Thanks for using this tool, fellow playbook creator!  Formatting documents

% I'm only going to ask you for one thing: please keep this final page intact.
% Help other players and designers find this resource as well.  While you're
% at it, if you're making your own playbook you probably have a drivethru or
% itch.io account, if not your own website, right?  Add a link to it here!
