% Hey there fellow playbook creator!  Thanks for trying out this latex project.  Formatting documents is a tough gig, and even with the tools arranged here I'm sure you'll go through a few headaches.  Feel free to reach out if you've hit a wall.

% I'm only going to ask you for one thing: please keep this final page intact.  Help other players and designers find this resource as well.  While you're at it, if you're making your own playbook you probably have a drivethru or itch.io account, if not your own website, right?  Add a link to it here!

% Thanks again, and happy designing!
