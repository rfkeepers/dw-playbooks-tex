%    How to use this.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% 
%   1.  You need Latex 2e installed.
%       If you already know latex you can skip ahead.  These instructions are
%       to help the playbook designers with no prior latex experience to find
%       their way around.
%
%   2.  This .tex document is what will build your playbook's pdf.  As a test
%       run, you should be able to create a pdf out of the template without
%       any issues.  If you run into problems before making changes, you might
%       need to fix your latex install before you do anything else.
%
%   3.  I've designed the playbook.cls to hide away as many of the gritty
%       details and chaff as is possible.  That means you get to plug in the
%       useful content without needing to tinker around with the outcome.
%       So long as your stuff is reasonabily similar in size to what you see,
%       it should all come out properly.
%
%   4.  In addition to hiding most details in the .cls file, the typesetting
%       commands should, I hope, naturally explain their design purpose. For
%       example: to write a move you use "\move{title}{details}".  To add an
%       option you use "\opt{details}" Blank lines are "\blank{length}", etc.
%
%       If you're new to Latex, this is all just formatting.  It's not really
%       functional.  IE: \looks is just the header, \looksOption makes the
%       text fit under that header.  It won't break anything if you use one
%       without the other.  Then again, if you want to hack into the design
%       that deeply you should jump into the .cls file and poke around  there.
%
%   5.  The one thing you do need to be cautious about is whitespace.  You'll
%       see a lot of \\ and \gap and \gapSm throughout the document.  Why?
%       Well, typesetting is a fickle process, and a lot of times it was easier
%       to achieve the correct layout by controlling it in the playbook, rather
%       than building that space into the other commands.  If you feel like
%       the text isn't lining up as well as you'd expect, go back and look at
%       how it was used here in the template.

% Hey there fellow playbook creator!  Thanks for trying out this latex project.  Formatting documents is a tough gig, and even with the tools arranged here I'm sure you'll go through a few headaches.  Feel free to reach out if you've hit a wall.

% I'm only going to ask you for one thing: please keep this final page intact.  Help other players and designers find this resource as well.  While you're at it, if you're making your own playbook you probably have a drivethru or itch.io account, if not your own website, right?  Add a link to it here!

% Thanks again, and happy designing!
