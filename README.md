# dw-playbooks-tex
Innumerable Engines' Latex files for composing Dungeon World Playbooks

## Building Your Own Playbooks

Want to use these files to build your own playbooks?  Do it!  All you need to begin is to get latex (2e) installed and ready to compile your work.  Once the language is installed, grab the three files listed below (no other images or fonts involved), put them into a folder, tell them to compile, and that's it.  If everything goes well, the Template should compile neatly into a pdf, and that's your signal to start ripping out the boilerplate and plugging in your own content.

This is all open source, so you don't need to ask me for permission to use or modify any of it.  Get it and go crazy.  All I ask is that you retain the link on the last page so that others can find the resource as well.

It's always fun to see what people make with these things, or hear how the process went.  Show me what you've worked on, or give me suggestions or feedback [via email](mailto:keepers@innumerable-engines.net).

Happy typesetting!
